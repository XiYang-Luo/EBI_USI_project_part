# EBI_USI_project_part
In order to solve the difficulty in identifying and accessing a specific spectrum in resources throughout the world, we are gathering the requirements for and developing the design for a universal spectrum identifier (USI). Such an identifier would be applicable to primary data generated by instruments, to entries within spectral libraries, and to data collections in repositories, both public and private. These identifiers are intended for proteomics but will ideally be fully applicable to metabolomics MS data as well.
I participated in a small part: about the generation of USI ID.
My pleasure
